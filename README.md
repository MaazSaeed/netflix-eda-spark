# Netflix Shows EDA Notebook

This Jupyter Notebook performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Netflix shows using PySpark and Python libraries. It processes and visualizes data to uncover insights into Netflix's catalog.

## File Contents
The notebook includes the following:

1. **Importing Libraries**
   - Python libraries used: `pyspark`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`.

2. **Spark Initialization**
   - A Spark session is set up to handle distributed data processing.

3. **Data Processing**
   - Data is ingested, cleaned, and prepared for analysis using PySpark and Pandas.

4. **Data Visualization**
   - Visualizations are created using Matplotlib and Seaborn to provide insights into trends and distributions.

5. **Package Management**
   - Ensures required packages are installed (`kagglehub`, etc.).

## Key Features
- **PySpark Integration**: Efficient handling of large datasets.
- **Data Cleaning**: Prepares the dataset by handling missing values and ensuring consistency.
- **Visual Insights**: Graphical representation of data for better understanding.

## Outputs
The notebook generates:
- Summary statistics of the dataset.
- Graphs and plots illustrating data trends and distributions.
